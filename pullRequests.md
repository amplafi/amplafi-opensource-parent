# Dealing with Pull Requests on Github#

First read the [github pull request explanation](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)

A pull request also generates an issue in your projects issue tracker.

Making comments that are associate with a line is a cinch.  
![You can enter comments relating to a line in a file.][pullRequestLineComment]

When in the discussion area, line comments have a special icon to tell readers that this comment is 
tied to a specific line in a file. If you click on the fileName:LXXX link then you will be forwarded 
to the line in question, and the comment.

The discussion area is great for communicating about specific changes in the pull request that need 
to take place before the request will be accepted. Also there is a button at the lower part of the 
page that you can use to perform the merge (if it can be performed cleanly).
