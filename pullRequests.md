# Dealing with Pull Requests on Github#

First read the [github pull request explanation](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)

A pull request also generates an issue in your projects issue tracker.  
![TODO][pullRequestIssue]

Making comments that are associate with a line is a cinch.  
![TODO][pullRequestLineComment]

When in the discussion area, line comments have a special icon to tell readers that this comment is 
tied to a specific line in a file. If you click on the fileName:LXXX link then you will be forwarded 
to the line in question, and the comment.  
![TODO][pullRequestLineCommentLink]  
![TODO][pullRequestLineCommentInFile]

The discussion area is great for communicating about specific changes in the pull request that need 
to take place before the request will be accepted. Also there is a button at the lower part of the 
page that you can use to perform the merge (if it can be performed cleanly).
